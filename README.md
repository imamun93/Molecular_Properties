# Predicting Molecular Properties

Data from Kaggle competition [Predicting Molecular Properties](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling?utm_medium=email&utm_source=intercom&utm_campaign=champs-email-launch). All data can be found there. Due to git size limitation, all data were ignored from this repo.


Finished basic EDA and found out which features are important at the [SNS and LGB file](https://github.com/imamun93/Molecular_Properties/blob/master/SNS%20and%20LGB%20EDA.ipynb). 

Finished working on creating a simple Linear Regression and then a more complex linear regression at the [Linear Regression Notebook](https://github.com/imamun93/Molecular_Properties/blob/master/LinearRegression.ipynb). This result failed. I do not see the point with moving forward with OLS type model.

Next models working on is [Random Forest](https://github.com/imamun93/Molecular_Properties/blob/master/RandomForest.ipynb) and then maybe XGboost (or AdaBoost) type of model.

The [Neural Network file](https://github.com/imamun93/Molecular_Properties/blob/master/SimpleNeuralNetwork.ipynb) is currently stopped and will resume after I have established a baseline model that works accurately.
