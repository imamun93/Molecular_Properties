# Predicting Molecular Properties

Data from Kaggle competition [Predicting Molecular Properties](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling?utm_medium=email&utm_source=intercom&utm_campaign=champs-email-launch). All data can be found there. Due to git size limitation, all data were ignored from this repo.


Currentky finished basic EDA and found out which features are important at the [SNS and LGB file](https://github.com/imamun93/Molecular_Properties/blob/master/SNS%20and%20LGB%20EDA.ipynb). 

The [Neural Network file](https://github.com/imamun93/Molecular_Properties/blob/master/SimpleNeuralNetwork.ipynb) is currently stopped and will resume after I finish a regular linear model.
